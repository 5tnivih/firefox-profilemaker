For the functions installing addons, you need to create a folder "extensions" from where you run the django project and place there the XPIs.
The Extension needs to have the name of its install.rdf file.

Currently they are:

- [CanvasBlocker@kkapsner.de.xpi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/canvasblocker/)
- [jid1-zUrvDCat3xoDSQ@jetpack.xpi](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/google-no-tracking-url/)
- [https-everywhere@eff.org.xpi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)
- [uBlock0@raymondhill.net.xpi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [uMatrix@raymondhill.net.xpi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/)
- [xclear@as-computer.de.xpi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xclear/)
- [{455D905A-D37C-4643-A9E2-F6FEFAA0424A}.xpi](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refcontrol/)
- [jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack.xpi](https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addons/506646/privacy_badger-2017.1.26.1-an+fx.xpi)

Things, that will not be included:

- Some cool addons. The addons list should be short and mostly privacy addons.
- Your favourite performance setting. It's not the scope of the project and not all people need the same performance settings.

You're welcome to create an own [profile](profiles/) for such settings or fork the whole project.
